Utilisez le caractère dédié. => Une des particularités du monde du logiciel libre est que l'on peut facilement entrer en contact avec les développeurs pour leur signaler un problème, une fonctionnalité manquante, un souhait... Ceci se fait via un rapport de bogue où l'utilisateur s'exprime de manière plus ou moins compréhensible et n'apporte pas forcément toutes les informations nécessaires. | ... => suggestions : ['…']

10 Accord de nombre erroné : « lire » devrait être au pluriel. => Dans les grands projets, plusieurs centaines de rapports sont envoyés par jour et les développeurs n'ont pas le temps de tous les lire, demander des précisions et continuer à développer en même temps. C'est là que les trieurs de bogues interviennent. Il s'agit de vérifier si les problèmes signalés ne sont pas déjà connus, de vérifier la véracité de l'information, compléter la description et le rapport s'il le faut, puis de passer le tout à la personne qui pourra résoudre le problème (les développeurs). | lire => suggestions : ['lires']

14 Espace(s) en début de ligne à supprimer : utilisez les retraits de paragraphe (ou les tabulations à la rigueur). =>   |   => suggestions : ['']
20 Il manque un espace. => Pour débuter il est recommandé de se concentrer sur les paquets de programmes que vous connaissez et utilisez, vous trouverez les bogues concernant un paquet en construisant une adresse du type : **%%https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nom_du_paquet%%** et en effectuant une recherche avancée pour identifier les bogues à trier. | https => suggestions : [' __URL']

27 Accord de nombre erroné avec « soumissions ». => Vous pouvez aussi utiliser un des moyens ci-dessous pour être averti des nouveaux bogues au fur et à mesure de leur soumissions :  | leur => suggestions : ['leurs']

35 Mot inconnu : Launchpad => Beaucoup de bogues sont rapportés sans indication du paquet à la source du problème ou associé à un paquet inadéquat, soit parce que le rapporteur n'a pas réussi à l'identifier, soit parce qu'il ne sait pas comment l'indiquer. Identifier le bon paquet est essentiel pour que la bonne équipe puisse traiter le bogue par la suite. Commencer par cette action d'identification de paquets est simple et vous permettra de vous familiariser rapidement avec Launchpad et ses communautés. | launchpad

44 Il faut élider “si” et l’accoler au pronom. => Un bogue est le duplicata d'un autre si ils ont la même origine. Plus vous connaîtrez un paquet ou un système, plus vous parviendrez à identifier ces doublons rapidement. Si vous avez un doute, n'hésitez pas à demander une seconde opinion. | si  => suggestions : ['s’']

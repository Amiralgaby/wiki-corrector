100 Mot inconnu : you => If you are a developer you may often times find yourself scouring the Internet looking for various API references and other technical information you may require while building your software. Sometimes this is the only way to find what you need but for many GNOME applications and libraries you can often find the information your are looking for is readily available via a neat little app called Devhelp. Devhelp consolidates various developer focused documentation into one convenient location so you always know where to find it. To install Devhelp simply install the package named '''devhelp'''. Once installed Devhelp is available at Applications -> Programming -> Devhelp. In addition to the documentation available via Devhelp by default you can install more documentation and even register your own apps documentation for use in Devhelp. Give it a try, it is nice to have all of the information you need in one easy to use location whether you are online or off.
